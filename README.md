# Manage: a CLI tool to manage your tasks and events

Manage is a Nodejs CLI tool that manages your tasks and events.

## Installation
If you have npm on your machine, run `npm i tdmanage`. This app uses `chalk`, `conf`, and `commander`. Works with nodejs version 16, but not with anything lower. To install dependencies, run `npm i chalk conf commander`.

## Usage
To start, run `manage help` to see the possible commands.

`manage` will keep track of your todos and the events you have, and display a calendar when prompted.

`manage todos` keeps track of your tasks, with due date support included. `manage events` works in a similar way, but it keeps track of specific events and weekly occurrences. 


# TODO
* Add a tagging/filtering system
* Add tasks that refresh daily 
* Make the calendar able to display more than a week of information
* Add ability to synchronize with online calendars (through ics)
